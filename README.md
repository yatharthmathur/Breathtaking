# Breathtaking
A fun project to implement object detection (the breathtaking Keanu Reeves) using ConvNet and image processing. The dataset was compiled by hand.


# Uses ConvNet and imageprocessing to detect Keanu Reeves in photos provided to the model. Trained using custom made dataset combined with Wiki data set for people.

# Requires :
Tensorflow, OpenCV, NumPy, Pandas
